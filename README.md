# AVL-Tree-Practice
Convert a BST into an AVL Tree

This code creates an AVL based on the file passed to it and will display each step in the insert
1. Insertion Begins
2. Root Check
3. Comparisons if root is full
4. Continue comparisons until open spot (null is found)
5. Adjust heights
6. Detect Imbalance
7. If Imbalance is present, perform rotations
8. Print out tree
9. Finally after file has been completely read, print the final tree

Implemented using recursion
